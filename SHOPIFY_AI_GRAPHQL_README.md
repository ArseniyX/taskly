## Usage Examples

The AI system can understand complex natural language queries:

### üõçÔ∏è Product Queries
- **"Show me products with low inventory"** ‚Üí AI generates filters for `totalInventory:<10`
- **"Find Nike products that are on sale"** ‚Üí AI searches for vendor + sale status
- **"List products created this week with variants"** ‚Üí AI adds date filters + variant fields
- **"Get expensive products over $100"** ‚Üí AI adds price range filters

### üì¶ Order Queries
- **"Show recent orders over $500"** ‚Üí AI filters by date + total price
- **"Find orders with pending payments"** ‚Üí AI filters by financial status
- **"Get orders from customer john@example.com"** ‚Üí AI searches by customer email
- **"List orders with more than 3 items"** ‚Üí AI adds line item count filters

### üë• Customer Queries
- **"Show customers who haven't ordered in 30 days"** ‚Üí AI generates date-based filters
- **"Find customers from California"** ‚Üí AI searches by address/location
- **"List top customers by order value"** ‚Üí AI adds sorting by total spent
- **"Get customers with abandoned carts"** ‚Üí AI generates checkout-specific queries

### üè∑Ô∏è Advanced Queries
- **"Show me all collections with more than 10 products"** ‚Üí AI adds product count filters
- **"Find draft products by specific vendor updated last month"** ‚Üí Complex multi-filter query
- **"Get orders shipped to New York with tracking numbers"** ‚Üí Location + fulfillment filters

## Setup & Configuration

### 1. Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
# OpenAI Configuration (Required)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Shopify Configuration (Already configured)
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_shopify_api_key
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=your_shopify_api_secret
SCOPES=read_products,write_products,read_orders,write_orders,read_customers,write_customers
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install ai openai zod
```

### 3. OpenAI API Key Setup

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create a new API key
3. Add it to your `.env` file as `OPENAI_API_KEY`

### 4. Test the Integration

Start your dev server and try queries like:
- "Show me all products"
- "Find orders from last week"
- "Get customers with no recent orders"

## How It Works

### 1. **AI Analysis Phase**
```typescript
// User query: "Show me products with low inventory"
const analysis = await aiQueryGenerator.analyzeQuery(userQuery);
// Result: { operation: "products", filters: [{ field: "totalInventory", operator: "less_than", value: "10" }] }
```

### 2. **Schema Introspection**
```typescript
// Get available fields for the Product type
const availableFields = await graphqlIntrospectionService.getTypeFields(admin, "Product");
// AI selects optimal fields based on query context
```

### 3. **Smart Query Generation**
```typescript
// AI generates optimized GraphQL with proper syntax and fields
const query = `#graphql
query getProducts($first: Int!, $query: String) {
  products(first: $first, query: $query) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        title
        totalInventory
        status
        createdAt
      }
    }
  }
}`;
```

### 4. **Execution & Results**
```typescript
// Execute and format results with AI-generated explanations
const result = await admin.graphql(query, { variables: { first: 10, query: "inventory_total:<10" } });
```

## Advanced Query Generation

The system can generate sophisticated queries based on user intent:

### Product Search with Variants
```graphql
query getProducts($first: Int!, $query: String) {
  products(first: $first, query: $query) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        title
        handle
        status
        variants(first: 5) {
          edges {
            node {
              id
              title
              price
              availableForSale
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Order Details with Customer Info
```graphql
query getOrders($first: Int!) {
  orders(first: $first) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        totalPriceSet {
          shopMoney {
            amount
            currencyCode
          }
        }
        customer {
          id
          displayName
          email
        }
        lineItems(first: 5) {
          edges {
            node {
              id
              title
              quantity
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Query Generation Errors**: Fallback to basic hardcoded queries
- **Validation Errors**: Display validation messages to users
- **Execution Errors**: Show GraphQL execution errors with helpful messages
- **MCP Connection Issues**: Graceful degradation to basic functionality

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Query Caching
Implement caching for frequently used queries to improve performance.

### 2. Query History
Add ability to save and reuse previous queries.

### 3. Advanced Filtering
Support for complex date ranges, numerical comparisons, and boolean logic.

### 4. Export Functionality
Allow users to export query results in various formats (CSV, JSON).

### 5. Query Templates
Pre-built query templates for common business operations.

## Testing

To test the AI GraphQL functionality:

1. Start your Shopify app development server
2. Navigate to the chat interface
3. Try natural language queries like:
   - "show me all products"
   - "find orders from last week"
   - "get customers with no orders"

The system will generate appropriate GraphQL queries, validate them, execute them, and display both the query and results in the chat interface.

## Security Considerations

- All queries are validated against the Shopify schema before execution
- Rate limiting should be implemented for AI query generation
- User permissions are enforced through Shopify's authentication system
- Query complexity analysis can be added to prevent expensive operations

## Performance Optimization

- Implement query result caching for frequently accessed data
- Use pagination efficiently to limit result set sizes
- Consider implementing query batching for multiple operations
- Monitor and log query performance for optimization opportunities
